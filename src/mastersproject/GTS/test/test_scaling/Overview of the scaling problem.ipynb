    "We refer to `test optimal scaling full model` from 02.04.20. There, we explored optimal values for scaling coefficients, and it turned out that we still have really poor condition number on the full setup (5 fractures). There are a number of reasons this may be the case:\n",
    "* The grid is poorly meshed:\n",
    "    * too few cells\n",
    "    * poorly chosen `mesh_args`\n",
    "* the complexity makes it a non-trivial problem\n",
    "    * five fractures is a lot. How does it compare to 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 fractures?"
