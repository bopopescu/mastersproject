    "# Fractures\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to experiment with fractures in a simple domain with simple boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some central questions to be asked:\n",
    "* How are solutions affected by high `aperture * fracture_perm` relative to rock permeability?\n",
    "* What about low?\n",
    "* What is the relationship between fracture aperature and fracture permeability? Look up `cubic law`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will consider a 2D domain with physical dimensions of $[0,1]^2$. As such, fractures are 1D lines, and interesctions of fractures are 0D points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\Omega$ be a unit square with boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. Consider a partition of the boundary in two parts consisting of $\\partial\\Omega_d$, representing Dirichlet boundary, and $\\partial\\Omega_n$, representing a Neumann boundary. By convention, let $\\mathbf{n}$ be the outward unit vector normal to $\\partial\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single phase flow, in its primal formulation, can be written as\n",
    "$$-\\nabla \\cdot K \\nabla p = f$$\n",
    "with boundary conditions on $\\partial\\Omega_n$ and $\\partial\\Omega_d$:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}=u_b, \\quad p = p_b$$\n",
    "Here, $f$ is a scalar source, $K$ is the permability tensor, $p_b$ is the pressure at the boundary (Dirichlet), and $u_b$ us the flux at the boundary (Neumann)."
